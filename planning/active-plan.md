## Phase 0: Co-Founder Offboarding & Domain Transfer

| # | Task | Description | Status |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 0.2 | **Remove Azhar from Google Workspace** | ✅ Removed `azhar@callsaver.ai` from Google Workspace Admin | ✅ |
| 0.3 | **Close Suspended AWS Account** | ✅ Old AWS account has been closed | ✅ |
| 0.4 | **Pay Google Workspace Bill** | Google Workspace subscription expires in ~25 days (around March 5, 2026). Ensure payment is current to avoid losing `alex@callsaver.ai` email access | ☐ |
| 0.6 | **Investigate Google Cloud Account** | **Deferred — current `scrumptiouslemur@gmail.com` account is working fine.** Will switch to `alex@callsaver.ai` later when funds are available to pay the delinquent bill. The `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is shared across **8 Google APIs** (Gemini, Places, Geocoding, Weather, PageSpeed, Maps JS, GBP, Routes). See `external-services-inventory.md` § 12 | ⏳ Deferred |

---

## Phase 1: Technical Resurrection (Remaining Tasks)

| # | Task | Description | Status |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1.6 | **Health Check: Analytics** | **✅ COMPLETED Feb 9, 2026.** GA4 and ContentSquare verified working (GA4 showing 3 users in last 30min, ContentSquare tracking confirmed). GrowthBook SDK connected but A/B testing deferred until later phase. Analytics debugger cleaned up (removed Hotjar, fixed Cal.com detection). Environment variables fixed (added NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix to GrowthBook credentials). | ✅ |
| 1.7 | **Cal.com GA4 Integration** | **✅ COMPLETED Feb 9, 2026.** Cal.com embed updated to: (1) Use `alexsikand/demo` (fixed from azharhuda), (2) Forward UTM params from page URL to embed config, (3) Listen for `bookingSuccessfulV2` events and fire GA4 `demo_booking_completed` conversion, (4) Track `bookerViewed` events for engagement. Booking form configured with 6 fields + hidden `qr_sid` for QR attribution. Embed colors updated to #4c00ff with forced light theme. | ✅ |
| 1.8 | **QR Code API Testing** | **✅ COMPLETED Feb 9, 2026.** QR scan tracking tested end-to-end on staging. Database migration applied, seed data created (`bcard` short code), QR image generated, `GET /q/bcard` returns 302 with `qr_sid` + UTMs + cookie, `/book` page loads Cal.com embed, scan events recorded correctly in DB. Vercel geo fields null as expected (ECS, not Vercel edge). See `qr-code-system.md` for full documentation. **Decision pending:** order business cards with staging QR codes or wait for production API. | ✅ |
| 1.9 | **Order Business Assets** | Submit Moo.com order for business cards and flyers after testing confirmed | ☐ |
| 1.10 | **Redeploy DocuSeal Server** | **✅ COMPLETED Feb 9, 2026.** Server deployed at `forms.callsaver.ai` with SES SMTP credentials. **SMTP credentials updated in EC2 instance** - password synced with Secrets Manager. Server restarted successfully with new credentials. **SMTP authentication tested and verified** - both external and in-container tests passed. Ready for production email sending. | ✅ |
| 1.10a | **Update DocuSeal API Key in Secrets Manager** | **✅ COMPLETED Feb 8, 2026.** After DocuSeal admin setup completed at `https://forms.callsaver.ai/setup`: (1) ✅ Signed in to DocuSeal admin. (2) ✅ Copied new API key from Settings → API. (3) ✅ Updated staging secret: `aws secretsmanager put-secret-value --secret-id callsaver/staging/backend/DOCUSEAL_API_KEY --secret-string "<new-key>"`. (4) Update production secret when ready: `aws secretsmanager put-secret-value --secret-id callsaver/production/backend/DOCUSEAL_API_KEY --secret-string "<new-key>"`. (5) Also update `DOCUSEAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` if a new webhook is configured. (6) Restart ECS tasks to pick up new secrets: `aws ecs update-service --cluster Callsaver-Cluster-staging --service callsaver-node-api-staging --force-new-deployment` | ✅ |
| 1.12 | **Deploy Web UI (Staging)** | **✅ COMPLETED Feb 9, 2026.** Deployed `callsaver-frontend` to `https://staging.app.callsaver.ai`. CloudFront CNAME conflict resolved via wildcard cert + associate-alias approach. Distribution: ELY11NNZH2QZK (`d1d69ehy9s378n.cloudfront.net`). S3 bucket: `callsaver-frontend-staging`. **ISSUE RESOLVED:** Fixed redirect loops by removing broken `require('https')` in `supabase-auth.ts` and reverting debug hacks. Staging fully functional. | ✅ |
| 1.15 | **Recreate All S3 Buckets (via CDK)** | **✅ COMPLETED Feb 10, 2026.** All S3 buckets CDK-managed in `Callsaver-Storage-staging`. Old account (086002003598) owns original names globally → new shared buckets use `callsaver-ai-` prefix. **Bucket Inventory:** (1) `callsaver-sessions-staging` (2) `callsaver-business-profiles` (3) `callsaver-frontend-staging` (4) `callsaver-web-ui-staging-v2` (5) `callsaver-ai-forms` (6) `callsaver-ai-cities-counties` — 50 JSONs uploaded (7) `callsaver-ai-voice-samples` — 9 WAVs uploaded. **IAM:** Dedicated `callsaver-docuseal-s3` user (`AKIA4FOROB4GPUUTIKNG`) with `DocuSealS3Access` policy scoped to `callsaver-ai-forms`. SES user `callsaver-ses-smtp` has only `AmazonSESFullAccess`. **Secrets Manager:** `docuseal/aws-access-key-id` + `docuseal/aws-secret-access-key` → new S3 user. `docuseal/s3-attachments-bucket` → `callsaver-ai-forms`. `SESSION_S3_BUCKET` → `callsaver-sessions-staging`. **Code audit:** All old bucket refs updated across `callsaver-api`, `callsaver-frontend`, `lead-gen-production`, `callsaver-docuseal`. EC2 `/opt/docuseal/.env` updated with new S3 credentials + restarted. | ✅ |
| 1.19 | **Update GitHub Actions Secrets** | Update all GitHub Actions secrets for both repos (see Section F). Key changes: new AWS credentials, new IAM role ARN, new CloudFront distribution IDs, production Stripe publishable key (`pk_live_`). Update hardcoded old account ID `086002003598` in `deploy-staging.yml` | ☐ |
| 1.20 | **Create Supabase Production Instance** | Create a separate Supabase project for production (`callsaver-production`, region: **West US / N. California**). **Start on Free plan** — upgrade to Pro happens at launch (task 4.20). Steps: (1) Create new Free org + project in Supabase dashboard. (2) Run Prisma migrations: `DATABASE_URL=<new-pooled-url> npx prisma migrate deploy`. (3) Configure Auth settings: magic link template, redirect URLs (`https://app.callsaver.ai/...`), email templates. (4) Copy new credentials: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`. (5) Update production Secrets Manager entries with new values. (6) **Migrate DocuSeal database** from staging Supabase to production Supabase: update `DATABASE_URL` in `/opt/docuseal/.env` on the EC2 instance to point to the new production Postgres, then restart DocuSeal (`sudo docker-compose down && sudo docker-compose up -d`). DocuSeal will re-run migrations on the new database. Re-create admin account at `https://forms.callsaver.ai/setup` and re-upload MSA template. **Staging continues to use existing project** (`arjdfatbdpegoyefdqfo.supabase.co`). This eliminates the risk of staging migrations breaking production | ☐ |
| 1.21 | **Configure LiveKit Cloud S3 Credentials** | **✅ COMPLETED Feb 11, 2026.** Created IAM user `callsaver-livekit-egress` (`AKIA4FOROB4GDBZH7JEY`) with `LiveKitEgressS3Access` inline policy scoped to `s3:PutObject`/`s3:PutObjectAcl`/`s3:ListBucket` on `callsaver-sessions-staging` and `callsaver-sessions-production`. Created comprehensive `services/livekit-egress-setup.md` and `docs/ai-agent/LIVEKIT_AGENT.md`. **No dashboard config needed** — agent initiates egress programmatically with per-request S3 credentials (via `AWS_SESSION_BUCKET` env var). Single LiveKit project shared by staging/production; environment isolation handled by per-environment env vars | ✅ |
| 1.22 | **Staging Validation Checkpoint** | **✅ COMPLETED Feb 9, 2026.** Status: (1) ✅ API health endpoint responds on `staging.api.callsaver.ai` (verified). (2) ✅ Web UI loads on `staging.app.callsaver.ai` — **DEPLOYED** and fully functional. (3) ✅ Magic link login works (Supabase auth). (4) ✅ API endpoints accessible — all endpoints working after `supabase-auth.ts` fix. (5) ✅ DocuSeal API reachable from backend (completed Feb 9, 2026 — https://forms.callsaver.ai accessible with updated SMTP). **Staging fully validated and ready for production deployment.** | ✅ |

---

## Phase 2: Federal & State Compliance

| # | Task | Description | Status |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 2.1 | **Form Prosimian Labs LLC (Wyoming)** | ✅ COMPLETED Feb 10, 2026. Articles of Organization filed with Northwest Registered Agent. Operating Agreement signed via DocuSeal. EIN obtained. Business documents stored in ~/callsaver-documents. | ✅ |
| 2.2 | **File DBA "CallSaver" (Santa Cruz County)** | **WAITING FOR CA LLC-12.** Will file after CA foreign LLC registration is approved and CA Statement of Information (Form LLC-12) is filed. FBN requires: Wyoming Certificate of Organization + CA SI-550. Filing fee: $50 + $8 for additional owner. Publication required within 45 days (4 weeks in Santa Cruz newspaper). | ⏳ Blocked on 2.8 |
| 2.3 | **Execute Solo Founder OA** | ✅ COMPLETED Feb 10, 2026. Northwest solo founder operating agreement drafted, reviewed, and signed via DocuSeal. | ✅ |
| 2.4 | **Get EIN** | ✅ COMPLETED Feb 10, 2026. EIN obtained from IRS for Prosimian Labs LLC. | ✅ |
| 2.5 | ~~**E-File 83(b) Election**~~ | **N/A — Not needed.** Single-member LLC with no equity grants; 83(b) election is unnecessary. | N/A |
| 2.6 | ~~**CA Virtual Office**~~ | **SKIPPED.** Not needed — principal place of business must be home address per CA FTB requirements. All filings (SOS, bank accounts, Stripe) already submitted with actual addresses. Virtual office would not change CA tax nexus determination. | N/A |
| 2.7 | **WY Certificate of Good Standing** | ✅ COMPLETED. Certificate of Existence obtained from Wyoming SOS. | ✅ |
| 2.8 | **CA Foreign Qualification** | **SUBMITTED Feb 10, 2026.** Form LLC-5 filed with California Secretary of State. Waiting for approval (1-2 business days). Uses Northwest as CA registered agent. | ⏳ In Progress |
| 2.9 | **CA Registered Agent** | ✅ COMPLETED. Northwest Registered Agent setup for California included in LLC-5 filing. | ✅ |
| 2.10 | **Compile Startup Expense Receipts** | Collect payment receipts for business formation, software costs, and laptop purchases (up to $5,000 IRS startup deduction). **Note:** Some expenses paid from mom's personal card — document as member loan: (1) Create a simple promissory note from LLC to mom, (2) LLC reimburses mom from Mercury once funded, (3) Keep receipts + note for tax records. Accounting connected to Mercury. | ☐ |

---

## Phase 3: Sales & Finance Infrastructure

> **Dependency note:** Tasks 3.1–3.2 require DBA (2.2), EIN (2.4), and CA Virtual Office (2.6) to be completed first.

| # | Task | Description | Status |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 3.1 | **Mercury & Stripe Setup** | ✅ Mercury application submitted (awaiting approval). ✅ Stripe account created and live (Feb 10, 2026) for Prosimian Labs LLC. Customer support address: 2108 N St, Ste N, Sacramento, CA 95816. | ✅ |
| 3.2 | **Stripe Production Mode** | ✅ Stripe account is live with production keys. ✅ Sandbox catalog verified (7 products, 11 prices, 1 meter). ✅ Portal configs updated — sandbox (`bpc_1SQ5SJGoKKfr9KQ55TTg4ndE`) + production (`bpc_1SznC3K6cCQ0p7wduEKtDCLv`) with `app.callsaver.ai/privacy-policy` + `/terms-of-service`. ✅ `.env` updated with all keys incl. `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_LIVE`. ✅ Dunning code fixed. ✅ Trial statement descriptor enabled. ✅ AWS Secrets Manager: 9 staging + 4 production secrets configured. **Remaining:** Run `setup-stripe-catalog.ts --env=production` + create production webhook + add 5 remaining production secrets (WEBHOOK_SECRET, METER_ID, 3× PRICE_*) | ⏳ Sandbox ✅ / Prod ☐ |
| 3.3 | **Stripe Webhooks (Staging + Production)** | ✅ Sandbox: 2 endpoints configured (ngrok local + staging.api.callsaver.ai) with signing secrets. ✅ Smart Retries enabled (8 retries / 2 weeks). ✅ STRIPE_SETUP.md §11 documents full interaction. ✅ Uploaded logo to Stripe Dashboard. ✅ Disabled Stripe built-in emails (sandbox + live). **Remaining:** Production webhook (`api.callsaver.ai`) deferred to Phase 5 deploy | ⏳ Sandbox ✅ / Prod ☐ |
| 3.4 | **AWS SES Domain Verification** | **✅ COMPLETED Feb 8, 2026.** Domain `callsaver.ai` verified in SES us-west-1. DKIM records added to DNS stack. All 6 sender identities verified: `alex@`, `info@`, `support@`, `billing@`, `legal@`, `reports@callsaver.ai` | ✅ |
| 3.4a | **Create SES SMTP Credentials for DocuSeal** | **✅ COMPLETED Feb 8, 2026.** IAM user `callsaver-ses-smtp` created with SES access. SMTP credentials stored in Secrets Manager. DocuSeal configured to send via SES | ✅ |
| 3.5 | **AWS SES Production Request** | **DEFERRED to closer to production deploy.** Submit production access request (see SES Production Request Draft in appendix). Takes 24-48 hours for AWS review. If rejected, switch to **Resend** as fallback — only requires API key swap in `email-adapter.ts`, supports same sender addresses. See SES Fallback Plan below | ⏳ Deferred |
| 3.6 | **Nango Webhooks (Staging + Production)** | Configure Nango webhook endpoints for staging and production environments (currently only points to ngrok) | ☐ |
| 3.7 | **Intercom Webhooks & Subscription** | Set up Intercom webhooks and verify subscription is active | ☐ |
| 3.8 | **Attio CRM: Account Migration** | ✅ COMPLETED. Attio CRM transferred from Azhar to Alex. | ✅ |
| 3.9 | **Attio CRM: Operator Plan Workflow** | Create Attio workflow to provision users on Operator plan (lower tier) | ☐ |
| 3.10 | **Attio CRM: Scale Plan Workflow** | Create Attio workflow to provision users on Scale plan (higher tier) | ☐ |
| 3.11 | **Cal.com Lead Enrichment** | Re-enable Cal.com; ensure webhook pushes enriched lead data to Attio (new account) | ☐ |
| 3.12 | **Pricing Review** | Review and finalize Operator, Growth, and Scale plan pricing before launch | ☐ |
| 3.13 | **Twilio Account Reactivation** | Pay $22 delinquent balance on Twilio account. Re-enable Twilio and LiveKit SIP integration. Currently mocked via `SKIP_TWILIO_PURCHASE=true` env var — set to `false` when ready for live phone provisioning. Verify existing provisioned numbers are still active | ☐ |
| 3.14 | ~~**Configure Cal.com Custom Domain**~~ | **SKIPPED.** Cal.com embed works fine with default URL. Custom domain not worth the effort for a booking widget. | N/A |
| 3.15 | **Configure Intercom Custom Domain** | **DEFERRED to closer to launch (free).** Set up `help.callsaver.ai` for Help Center. Do this after Help Center content is written (4.8). **Setup steps:** (1) Go to Intercom → [Help Center Settings](https://app.intercom.io/a/apps/_/articles/site/settings) → General → Domains. (2) Enter `help.callsaver.ai`. (3) Intercom will show target URL — for HTTPS quick setup use `us.intercomhelpcenter.com` (US region). (4) In Route 53, create CNAME: `help` → `custom.intercom.help` (US region). (5) DNS propagation up to 72 hours (usually faster). (6) For HTTPS: use "HTTPS (quick setup)" if available in workspace — Intercom auto-provisions SSL. Otherwise use AWS CloudFront: create distribution with origin `custom.intercom.help` (HTTPS only, TLSv1.2), forward all headers/cookies/query strings (legacy cache settings), add `help.callsaver.ai` as alternate domain name with ACM cert, then CNAME `help` → CloudFront distribution domain. (7) Existing `intercom.help/callsaver` links auto-redirect. **Important:** For logged-in user recognition + audience targeting, Help Center must share top-level domain with app (`callsaver.ai` ✅). **Ref:** https://developers.intercom.com/docs/guides/help-center/custom-domains | ⏳ Deferred |
| 3.17 | **Configure Stripe Custom Domain** | **DEFERRED — $10/mo cost.** Not needed for launch; Stripe's default `checkout.stripe.com` is universally trusted and arguably better for payment page credibility. Revisit once revenue justifies the spend. Setup when ready: `billing.callsaver.ai` → Stripe Dashboard → Settings → Custom domains. Route 53: CNAME `billing` → `hosted-checkout.stripecdn.com` + TXT `_acme-challenge.billing` → value from dashboard. **Ref:** https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-domains | ⏳ Deferred |
| 3.16 | **Configure Supabase Custom Domain** | Deferred to **task 4.20** (right before launch). Custom domain `auth.callsaver.ai` requires Pro plan. Will be enabled when production org is upgraded to Pro. DNS CNAME already in checklist | ☐ |
| 3.18 | **AWS Activate Credits** | **✅ APPLIED Feb 11, 2026.** Founders Package ($1,000) submitted with "No funding" status. Awaiting approval (7-10 business days). Credits auto-apply to AWS account `836347236108`. Covers all AWS services incl. S3, ECS, SES, Bedrock. Expire in 1-2 years. Check status: https://aws.amazon.com/startups/credits/status | ⏳ Applied |

---

## Phase 4: Pre-Launch Polish & Operations

| # | Task | Description | Status |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 0.7 | **Restrict Google API Keys** | After resolving GCP account: (1) **Backend key** (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`) — restrict to Gemini, Places, Geocoding, Weather, PageSpeed, GBP, Routes APIs + IP-restrict to ECS NAT Gateway IPs. (2) **Frontend key** (`VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`) — restrict to Maps JavaScript API + HTTP referrer restrict to `*.callsaver.ai`, `localhost:*` | ☐ |
| 0.8 | **Audit All External Service Accounts** | For each of the 23 external services (see `external-services-inventory.md`), verify: which email owns the account, billing is current, API keys are valid. Priority: AWS, Google Cloud, Twilio, Google Workspace, Namecheap (🔴 P0), then OpenAI, Deepgram, Cartesia, Anthropic, AssemblyAI, LiveKit, Sentry, Vercel, Attio, Nango, Intercom (🟡 P1) | ☐ |
| 4.1 | **MSA / Privacy Policy / TOS Review** | **✅ COMPLETED Feb 11, 2026.** Legal docs aligned across all properties: (1) URL convention unified to `/privacy-policy` and `/terms-of-service` everywhere. (2) App privacy policy rewritten to sync with MSA §6/§8-§14 (entity info, full subprocessor list, GDPR rights, data retention). (3) App TOS rewritten to sync with MSA §15/§18-§20 (acceptable use, billing, liability, indemnification). (4) Landing page TOS/PP section numbering fixed + governing law aligned to California. (5) MSA URLs updated in `generate-msa-pdf.ts`. (6) All cross-references updated (Stripe portal, DocuSeal, login form). **Note:** MSA PDF must be regenerated before DocuSeal upload to include new URLs | ✅ |
| 4.2 | **Sentry Error Tracking** | Reactivate Sentry subscription (trial expired); verify error tracking is operational for `callsaver-api` and `callsaver-web-ui` | ☐ |
| 4.3 | **API Key Rotation** | Rotate all API keys across services (new AWS account invalidates all AWS keys); audit every service referencing old keys and update env vars across Secrets Manager, GitHub Actions secrets, and local `.env` files | ☐ |
| 4.4 | **CI/CD Pipeline Review** | Evaluate moving from local deploys to: Vercel branch deploys for `callsaver-landing`, GitHub Actions/workflow deploys for `callsaver-api` and `callsaver-web-ui`; set up staging → production promotion. Update `deploy-staging.yml` with new account role ARN. Regenerate Cosign keys for image signing. **⚠️ Verify `deploy-prod.yml` exists** in `callsaver-api/.github/workflows/` — the Deployment Scripts section references it but only `ci.yml`, `deploy-staging.yml`, and `publish-and-update-ui.yml` were found. If it doesn't exist, create it based on `deploy-staging.yml` with production role ARN, production ECR repo, and manual approval gate | ☐ |
| 4.7 | **Landing Page Copy Review** | Pre-launch review of messaging, positioning, and CTAs on callsaver.ai | ☐ |
| 4.7a | **Screen Recording Tool Evaluation** | Evaluate screen recording tools for dashboard video: Focusee, Cap.so, Poindeo. Test each tool's features, pricing, and output quality. Choose best option for recording dashboard demo video. | ☐ |
| 4.7b | **Update Logo Font (License Issue)** | **✅ COMPLETED Feb 11, 2026.** Logo recreated with Figtree font (OFL licensed). All repos updated. Font toggle removed. See detail section below. | ✅ |
| 4.7c | **Figtree Font Size Audit** | Figtree renders tighter/smaller than Inter at equivalent sizes. Audit and adjust font sizes across: (1) `~/callsaver-landing` — `_variables.scss` (`$font-size-root`, `$font-size-base`, heading sizes), `style.scss`, component overrides. (2) `~/callsaver-frontend` — `theme.css`, `index.css`, Tailwind config, component `text-[]` classes. MSA PDF sizing confirmed OK — no changes needed. | ☐ |
| 4.8 | **Help Center / Documentation** | Set up customer-facing help center using **Intercom Articles**. Steps: (1) Go to Intercom → Articles → Help Center → turn on Help Center. (2) Write initial articles: Getting Started, How AI Agent Works, Managing Your Account, Billing & Plans, Troubleshooting. (3) Organize into collections (e.g. Getting Started, Account, Billing, Technical). (4) Customize Help Center appearance (logo, colors, branding). (5) After content is ready, configure custom domain `help.callsaver.ai` (task 3.15). **Note:** Help Center shares top-level domain with `app.callsaver.ai`, enabling logged-in user recognition and audience targeting for articles | ☐ |
| 4.9 | **Status Page** | Set up public status page (e.g., BetterUptime, Instatus) for customer trust | ☐ |
| 4.10 | **Social Proof** | Get testimonial from Travis (electrician) for landing page | ☐ |
| 4.11 | **Upload DocuSeal MSA Template** | **✅ COMPLETED Feb 11, 2026.** MSA PDF regenerated with updated URLs (`/privacy-policy`, `/terms-of-service`), Figtree font, local date + timestamp naming (`MSA-YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm.pdf`). Uploaded to DocuSeal at forms.callsaver.ai. Template fields configured: 5 Customer fields (Legal Name, Company, Title — read-only/pre-filled from Attio; Date — auto-sign; Signature) + 4 CallSaver fields (Legal Name — Alexander Sikand, Title — Founder, both read-only; Date; Signature). Signing order: Customer first → CallSaver countersigns. Template name contains "MSA" for `getLatestMSATemplateId()` auto-detection | ✅ |
| 4.12 | **Replace Google Maps with MapCN** | Replace the Google Maps component in location cards (`~/callsaver-frontend`) with [MapCN](https://www.mapcn.dev/) for a more custom/modern feel instead of the default Google Maps UI. MapCN is a React map component library. Evaluate: (1) Does it support the pin/marker features we need? (2) Does it work with our existing geocoded lat/lng data? (3) Can we remove the Google Maps JS API dependency from the frontend (saves `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` exposure + bundle size)? | ☐ |
| 4.12a | **LiveKit Agents-UI: Landing Page Audio Visualizer** | **✅ COMPLETED Feb 11, 2026.** Replaced Wave.js turntable with standalone LiveKit-inspired Aura shader visualizer (WebGL + Web Audio API). Added smooth two-phase enter/exit animation. Also fixed: geo banner + header combined overlay slide-in, nav/banner font 18px/600, button alignment, hover transition, GA4 `play_call_demo_clicked` event, GrowthBook error suppression, dev FontControlWidget. Commit `7b7e79d`. | ✅ |
| 4.12b | **LiveKit Agents-UI: Interactive Voice Agent in Frontend** | Add a LiveKit-powered interactive voice agent UI to the per-location settings in `~/callsaver-frontend` (`LocationsPage`). Currently users can only play a sample of their voice agent — this would let them **actually talk to their configured agent** via WebRTC (no phone/Twilio needed). Use `@livekit/agents-ui` React components to build an in-browser voice interface that connects to the LiveKit Python agent API. Steps: (1) Add LiveKit room token generation endpoint to API. (2) Integrate `@livekit/components-react` in LocationsPage. (3) Connect to the same Python voice agent that handles phone calls. (4) Add start/stop controls and audio visualization. | ☐ |
| 4.13 | **CloudWatch Alarms** | Set up CloudWatch alarms for: API ALB 5xx error rate, ECS task health (unhealthy count > 0), ECS CPU/memory utilization > 80%, ALB target response time > 5s. Configure SNS topic to email `alex@callsaver.ai` for alerts. **Also add alarms for Agent service** (CPU/memory, task health) | ☐ |
| 4.20 | **Upgrade Supabase Production to Pro** | **Do this right before launch to avoid unnecessary cost.** Upgrade the production Supabase organization to Pro ($25/mo). This unlocks: daily backups with PITR, no 7-day pause risk, 8 GB database (vs 500 MB), 100 GB storage, email support. Then enable custom domain `auth.callsaver.ai` on the production project (Pro required). Add CNAME record to Route 53 (already in DNS checklist). Update `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_AUTH_REDIRECT_URL` in production GitHub Actions secrets to use `https://auth.callsaver.ai`. **Staging stays on Free** — pausing and lack of backups don't matter for dev/test | ☐ |

### Task 4.7b Detail: Logo Font Update — ✅ COMPLETED (Feb 11, 2026)

**Problem:** Old logo used Avenir Next (commercial license). Recreated in Inkscape with **Figtree** font (OFL licensed).

**Simplified logo scheme (2 variants × 3 formats = 6 files):**
- `black-logo.{svg,png,webp}` — Black text on transparent (light backgrounds)
- `white-logo.{svg,png,webp}` — White text on transparent (dark backgrounds)

**What was done:**
1. ✅ Created `black-logo.svg` and `white-logo.svg` in Inkscape (Figtree Medium, 988×152px)
2. ✅ Exported PNG (via `inkscape --export-png`) and WebP (via ImageMagick `convert`)
3. ✅ Replaced logos in `~/callsaver-landing/public/img/` (6 files)
4. ✅ Replaced logos in `~/callsaver-frontend/public/` (7 files incl. `images/` dupe)
5. ✅ Replaced `~/callsaver-api/email-previews/black-logo.png` (MSA PDF letterhead)
6. ✅ Replaced `~/callsaver-api/public/white-logo.svg` (email logo) + `logo-header.png`
7. ✅ Deleted all Sandbox template logos (logo-dark, logo-light, logo-purple, logo@2x, etc.)
8. ✅ Updated `generate-msa-pdf.ts`: replaced Avenir Next with configurable Inter/Figtree, generates both versions
9. ✅ Removed Avenir Next from `~/callsaver-frontend/index.html`, added Figtree to Google Fonts
10. ✅ Replaced `--font-avenir` CSS variable with `--font-figtree` in `theme.css`
11. ✅ Added floating font comparison widget to both landing page and frontend (temporary, remove before launch)

**Still pending:**
- **Stripe** — Upload new logo in Stripe Dashboard → Settings → Branding
- **DocuSeal** — Upload logo (requires Pro plan, $240/yr — see `~/callsaver-docuseal/DOCUSEAL_SETUP.md` section 11)
- **Business cards** — Update Moo.com templates
- ✅ **Font decision MADE (Feb 11)** — Figtree everywhere. Font toggle widgets removed from both repos.

---

## Phase 5: Production Deployment

> **Do not start this phase until staging validation (1.22) is complete and Phases 2-3 are substantially done.**

| # | Task | Description | Status |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1.13 | **Reconstruct AWS Infrastructure (Production API)** | Stand up production ECS/Fargate environment: `Callsaver-Network-production`, `Callsaver-Storage-production`, `Callsaver-Backend-production`, `Callsaver-Agent-production`. Create production Secrets Manager entries under `callsaver/production/backend/` and `callsaver/production/agent/` | ☐ |
| 1.14 | **Deploy Web UI (Production)** | Deploy `callsaver-frontend` production: run CDK for `FrontendProductionStack`, then deploy static build. May need same wildcard cert + associate-alias approach if `app.callsaver.ai` has same CNAME conflict from old account | ☐ |
| 1.17 | **Create All AWS Secrets Manager Entries (Production)** | Create all secrets under `callsaver/production/backend/` and `callsaver/production/agent/`. Use production-specific values where different. **Run `scripts/setup-stripe-catalog.ts` against production Stripe** to generate live catalog IDs | ☐ |
| 4.6 | **Environment Separation Verification** | Final verification pass: distinct staging/production configs, separate databases, env vars, webhook endpoints | ☐ |

---

3. Figtree font size audit (4.7c)

**This Week:**
1. Complete remaining Stripe production setup (catalog, webhooks) — blocked on `api.callsaver.ai` deploy
2. Wait for CA LLC-5 approval → file LLC-12 → file FBN
3. Complete remaining pre-launch tasks (Phase 4)
4. Wait for AWS Activate credits approval (7-10 business days)

**Key Dependencies:**
- **Redirect loop fix → Staging validation (1.22)**
- **DocuSeal SMTP update (1.10) → Full staging validation**
- **Phase 2 tasks 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6 must complete before Phase 3 banking setup**
- **Production deployment (1.13, 1.14) should wait for staging validation (1.22)**
- **Supabase Pro upgrade (4.20) should happen right before launch to avoid costs**
- Production CNAME `app.callsaver.ai` may need same wildcard + associate-alias fix

**Architecture Notes:**
- **DNS:** Single `Callsaver-DNS` stack manages all Route 53 records (shared across environments)
- **DocuSeal:** Single server at `forms.callsaver.ai` — test mode for staging, production mode for production. Both environments share the same URL, differentiated by API key

## Current Issues

### CloudFront CNAME Conflict — RESOLVED ✅ (Feb 9, 2026)

**Error:** `"One or more of the CNAMEs you provided are already associated with a different resource"` (HTTP 409)

**Root Cause:** The CNAME `staging.app.callsaver.ai` was registered in a **suspended AWS account** (old account). When that account was suspended, the CloudFront distribution was deleted but CloudFront's global CNAME registry still held the association.

**Solution Applied:** Wildcard certificate + associate-alias approach (per AWS documentation)

**Steps Taken:**
1. ✅ Requested wildcard ACM certificate `*.app.callsaver.ai` in us-east-1
2. ✅ Deployed FrontendStagingStack with wildcard alias `*.app.callsaver.ai` (bypasses specific CNAME conflict)
3. ✅ Added DNS TXT record `_staging.app.callsaver.ai → d1d69ehy9s378n.cloudfront.net` for ownership verification
4. ✅ Ran `aws cloudfront associate-alias --target-distribution-id ELY11NNZH2QZK --alias staging.app.callsaver.ai` to claim the domain
5. ✅ Updated CDK stack to use `staging.app.callsaver.ai` instead of wildcard
6. ✅ Built frontend with staging environment variables
7. ✅ Deployed assets to S3 bucket `callsaver-frontend-staging`
8. ✅ Fixed S3 bucket policy for CloudFront OAI access

**Final Result:**
- **Distribution:** ELY11NNZH2QZK (`d1d69ehy9s378n.cloudfront.net`)
- **Custom Domain:** https://staging.app.callsaver.ai ✅ LIVE
- **SSL Certificate:** Valid (wildcard cert from ACM)
- **Status:** Fully functional staging frontend

## Important Fixes Applied

### DocuSeal Database Configuration (Feb 8, 2026)

**Issue:** DocuSeal container was stuck in restart loop with database configuration errors.

**Root Cause:** The Docker setup was trying to use `DATABASE_URL` which caused Rails to parse the ERB template incorrectly.

**Solution:**
1. **Removed `DATABASE_URL`** from environment variables
2. **Added bind mount `./data:/data`** to persist SQLite database
3. **Let DocuSeal use default SQLite** at `/data/db.sqlite3` (built-in behavior)

**Result:** DocuSeal now boots successfully with default SQLite database, migrations run automatically.

### DNS A Record Missing for forms.callsaver.ai (Feb 8, 2026)

**Issue:** Caddy couldn't obtain SSL certificate due to NXDOMAIN for forms.callsaver.ai.

**Root Cause:** The `Callsaver-DNS` stack requires `elasticIp` context value to create the A record for forms.callsaver.ai.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Deploy DNS stack with elasticIp context
pnpm cdk deploy Callsaver-DNS \
  -c hostedZoneId=Z0339740EIC19MEVQ7EI \
  -c elasticIp=52.53.135.206 \
  -c deploy_backend=false \
  --require-approval never
```

**Key Points:**
- Must pass `elasticIp` context when deploying DNS stack
- Use `deploy_backend=false` to avoid backend stack dependencies
- DNS record now correctly points: `forms.callsaver.ai → 52.53.135.206`

**Result:** https://forms.callsaver.ai is now accessible with valid SSL certificate.

## Phase 3: Legal & Compliance (Web App)

| # | Task | Description | Status |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 3.1 | **Create Web App Privacy Policy & Terms of Service** | **✅ COMPLETED Feb 11, 2026.** Created comprehensive, MSA-synced privacy policy and terms of service for `app.callsaver.ai`. **Strategy:** Separate documents for landing page (website visitors) and web app (paying customers), both referenced by MSA. **What was done:** (1) Rewrote `PrivacyPage.tsx` — synced subprocessor list with MSA §8 (11 categories incl. Anthropic, AssemblyAI, Supabase, Google Maps, scheduling integrations), entity info, data rights, retention, international transfers. (2) Rewrote `TermsPage.tsx` — synced acceptable use with MSA §15, added billing/trial/SLA sections, liability caps, indemnification. (3) Unified URL convention to `/privacy-policy` and `/terms-of-service` across all properties. (4) Updated MSA URLs in `generate-msa-pdf.ts` (§6.2, §22.1). (5) Fixed landing page section numbering + governing law (Wyoming → California). (6) Updated Stripe portal, DocuSeal refs, login form links. **Architecture:** MSA is master doc, app pages supplement it (MSA §22.2 order of precedence), app pages updateable without re-signing MSA (§22.3) | ✅ |

## 🏦 Mom's Card Expenses — Reimbursement Protocol

> **Some startup expenses were paid from mom's personal card.** These are still deductible as business expenses. Here's the proper protocol:

### How to Handle It (Member Loan Approach)

1. **Document as a Member Loan**
   - Mom's payments are treated as a **loan from a third party to the LLC**
   - The LLC received the benefit of the expense, so the LLC gets the deduction

2. **Create a Simple Promissory Note**
   - One-page document stating:
     - Mom loaned $X to Prosimian Labs LLC for startup expenses
     - Itemized list of expenses (or attach receipts)
     - LLC will reimburse when funded
     - 0% interest (permissible for family loans under $10K)
   - Both parties sign and date
   - Store in `~/callsaver-documents/`

3. **Reimburse from Mercury**
   - Once Mercury account is funded, transfer the exact total back to mom
   - Use memo: "Reimbursement for pre-formation startup expenses per Schedule A"
   - This creates a clean paper trail

4. **Keep All Receipts**
   - Save mom's card statements showing each charge
   - Save the promissory note
   - Save the Mercury transfer confirmation
   - All go in Schedule A for tax filing

### Why This Works
- IRS cares about **who benefited** from the expense, not whose card was swiped
- As a single-member LLC (disregarded entity), expenses flow to your Schedule C
- The loan + reimbursement creates proper documentation
- Up to **$5,000 in startup costs** can be deducted in the first year (IRS §195)

### ⚠️ What NOT to Do
- Don't claim the deduction without documenting the loan
- Don't skip the reimbursement — it creates a messy paper trail
- Don't mix personal and business expenses going forward (use Mercury for everything)

## 💰 Legacy Cost Estimates (Reference Only)

### Original Budget Estimates
- **Wyoming Formation**: ~$50-100 (Northwest package)
- **California Compliance**: $100 filing + $800 franchise tax + $20 SI + $125 RA = $1,045
- **Santa Cruz DBA**: $50-58 filing + $60 publication = $110-118
- **Original Grand Total Estimate**: ~$1,205-1,263 (first year, compliance only)
